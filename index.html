        <h2>User Login Exercise</h2>
        <p><strong>Overview:</strong> In this exercise, you will learn some basics principals of internet security by creating a login page for users. You will review some of the <a href="#review_documentation">html elements</a> that you learned about in previous lessons (forms, inputs, etc). You will learn: a high level overview of user authentication, and how user passwords can be stored in a database. You will implement a comparison of inputs while reviewing the purpose and utility of hash functions. Below there is some <a href="#project_documentation">documentation</a> on the framework provided for this project.</p>
        <p><strong>Intro:</strong> We use logins for nearly everything today. Have you ever wondered how they work? Most web logins consist of a username and password. While some logins also require another code or a fingerprint or a usb key, we won't dive into MFA (multi-factor authentication) and why it's important in this exercise. We won't talk about password managers either, although that is another good practice for you to research later.</p>
        <p>So how do usernames and passwords work? When you first register for a website, you typically choose your own username and login. You enter them into a form, and that data is sent to the server and stored in a database. The next time you want to log into the site, you must enter the same username and password to be granted access. Only if what you enter when you return matches what you entered when you registered, will you get access. So what happens behind the scenes?</p>
        <p>Is your username and password saved in that database, and used for comparison when you try to login again? That seems like a pretty straightforward solution to program:</p>
        <pre><code>
        if (entered_username==db_username && entered_password==db_password) {
          return true;
        } else {
          return false;
        }
        </code></pre>
        <p>What are the drawbacks to this approach? If the database is breached, then everyone will know all your users passwords. Google 'database breaches' if you don't think they're a big deal (and a good reason to use password managers). But what other option do we have if we don't store username and passwords in the database? How else can you check that a user is entering the same information?</p>
        <p>This is where hash functions come into play. Hash functions are 'one-way' functions that can take a key as input and return a mostly-unique, consistent value every time. For example: <code>hash('hello world')</code> might return 'aGVsbG93IHdvcmxk'. That means that everytime that a user enters 'hello world', the hash function will return 'aGVsbG93IHdvcmxk'. So now we can compare the hash instead of the password. The key difference between just comparing the password and comparing the hash of the password is, if you are given 'aGVsbG93IHdvcmxk', it is computationally infeasible to return 'hello world'.</p>

        <p>A `project` object that is provided to help simulate some of the functions needed to complete this task.</p>
        <br>
        <code>
            project.connect(dbuser, dbpass, dbhost)
                returns {a database connection object}
        </code>
        <p>The default dbuser is 'admin', dbpass is 'password', and dbhost is 'localhost'. This function simulates the connection to a database that might be created through a module.</p>
        <br>
        <code>
            project.select(connection, username)
                returns {an object with the username, hashed password, and salt from the database}
        </code>
        <br>
        <p>The expected username is 'student', password is 'password'. This function simulates the results of executing a select statement on a SQL database.</p>
        <code>
            project.hash(key)
                returns {the hashed value of the key}
        </code>
        <p>This function simulates a hash function where the returned value will be consistent if the key if the same.</p>

        <p>Html form elements are used to get input from users. A form has a number of attributes:
          <ul>
            <li>action: the destination where the input will be sent</li>
            <li>method: the way the input will be sent, a get request will be visible in the users browser, while a post request will be sent embedded in the body of the request</li>
            <li>target: the way that a response will be displayed</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <code>&lt;form action="#" method="get" target="_self"&gt; &lt;/form&gt;</code>
        <p>Forms have input elements that allow users to enter data. Inputs can have many types, some of the more common types are: text, email, number, datetime, password, checkbox, radio, button, file, and submit. When the data is sent within a form, it needs to be paired with an identifier, called the name. This is the key that is used to match which value a user entered in the specific input.</p>
        <code>&lt;input type="text" name="input"&gt;</code>
        <p>Labels are needed so that users know what an input is used for. When associated correctly (using the for attribute), if the user clicks on the label the corresponding input field will come into focus.</p>
        <code>&lt;label for="input_id"&gt;</code>
